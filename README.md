# breast-cancer-deep-learning


Breast cancer is causing an alarming increase in the number of deaths each year. This is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of mortality in women all over the world. Any advancement in cancer illness prediction and detection is critical to living a healthy life. As a result, high accuracy in cancer prediction is critical for updating therapy aspects and patient survivability standards. Deep learning techniques, which have been shown to have a significant impact on the process of breast cancer prediction and early diagnosis, have become a research hotspot and have been proven to be a powerful technique.

The proposed study effort has constructed a Deep learning model that is trained using characteristics including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, concavity, concaveness, and compactness. However, I attempted to identify and select the most important features, and to predict using only these features rather than all of them.
